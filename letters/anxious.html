    <h1>When You're Anxious 🌧️</h1>
    <p>My love, I know anxiety creeps in like a fog — quietly, slowly, and all at once.
    I can’t be there to hold your hand, but I want you to imagine mine in yours, fingers interlaced, grounding you.
    <br><br>
    Breathe, baby. In and out. Your chest rising is a reminder that you’re here — strong and alive.
    Whatever it is, it’s okay. You don’t need to fix everything right now. You don’t need to do everything perfectly.
    <br><br>
    Close your eyes for a minute. Imagine I’m with you. We'd lie down, watch the ceiling spin, and I’d say — "You’re safe, silly. You’re doing amazing."
    <br><br>
    You are not your anxious thoughts. They are clouds, but you’re the sky. And even on the stormiest day, my love for you is constant like the stars behind the clouds.
    <br><br>
    I’m proud of you for facing the day, even when your mind feels heavy. I love every part of you — even the overthinking, overstressed, tired version.
    <br><br>
    You are never alone.
