  <h1>When You're Happy 🌞</h1>
  <p>
    Seeing you happy is my favorite thing in the world. Your laugh? It’s the sweetest melody. Your joy? It makes everything brighter—even from miles away.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope in this moment, you’re smiling that adorable smile of yours that reaches your eyes. I hope you're doing something that makes you feel alive and proud and warm inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though I’m not there physically, I promise I’m dancing in my room thinking about how cute you look when you’re happy. Please take a second and send me a text when you feel like this. I want to celebrate with you—even if it’s with just a silly meme or a 3 a.m. call.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep this light in your heart. You deserve all the happiness in the world, my sunshine.
